# AI Framework Schema (AFS) Specification v1.0.0

## Overview

The AI Framework Schema (AFS) is a standardized format for describing software frameworks, libraries, and tools in a way that AI models can quickly understand and become expert users. Similar to how OpenAPI describes REST APIs for developers, AI Framework Schema describes software capabilities for AI consumption.

## Purpose

- **Instant Expertise**: Enable AI models to quickly understand complex software systems
- **Consistent Learning**: Provide structured information that AI can reliably process
- **Practical Guidance**: Include actionable patterns and examples for real-world usage
- **Context Awareness**: Help AI understand when and how to recommend technologies

## Schema Structure

- Complex features requiring deeper understanding
- Integration patterns
- Performance considerations

#### 8. `common_patterns` (object)
- Frequent use cases with solutions
- Problem-solution pairs
- Template code for common scenarios

#### 9. `troubleshooting` (object)
- Common issues and solutions
- Debugging guidance
- Known limitations

#### 10. `examples_library` (object)
- Reference implementations
- Categorized by complexity and use case
- Links to working examples

#### 11. `ai_assistance_guidelines` (object)
- Instructions for how AI should help users
- Code generation best practices
- Debugging assistance approaches

## Design Principles

### 1. AI-First Design
- Structure information for machine processing
- Use consistent terminology and patterns
- Include explicit guidance for AI behavior

### 2. Practical Focus
- Emphasize working code examples
- Include real-world usage patterns
- Address common problems and solutions

### 3. Context Awareness
- Help AI understand appropriate usage scenarios
- Include guidance on when NOT to use something
- Provide decision-making criteria

### 4. Hierarchical Complexity
- Start with basic concepts
- Progress to advanced features
- Clearly mark complexity levels

### 5. Actionable Information
- Include runnable code examples
- Provide step-by-step patterns
- Focus on practical implementation

## Usage Guidelines

### For Schema Authors
1. **Start with Core Concepts**: Identify the 3-5 most important concepts
2. **Include Negative Cases**: Specify when NOT to use the technology
3. **Provide Working Examples**: Every pattern should include functional code
4. **Test with AI**: Validate that AI models can effectively use the schema
5. **Keep Updated**: Maintain schema alongside software updates

### For AI Models
1. **Parse Systematically**: Start with `ai_context` to understand applicability
2. **Learn Hierarchically**: Master `core_concepts` before `advanced_features`
3. **Use Patterns**: Leverage `common_patterns` for code generation
4. **Provide Context**: Always explain why you're recommending something
5. **Handle Limitations**: Be aware of troubleshooting and limitations

### For Tool Builders
1. **Validate Schemas**: Create tools to validate AI Framework Schema format
2. **Generate Documentation**: Use schemas to create human-readable docs
3. **Enable Discovery**: Build search and recommendation systems
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track how effectively AI uses different schemas

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Framework Learning
AI can quickly become proficient with new frameworks by consuming their AI Framework Schema, understanding core patterns and best practices.

### 2. Code Generation
AI can generate more accurate, idiomatic code by following the patterns and guidelines in the schema.

### 3. Technology Recommendation
AI can make better technology recommendations by understanding use cases, limitations, and integration patterns.

### 4. Debugging Assistance
AI can provide targeted debugging help by understanding common issues and their solutions.

### 5. Architecture Guidance
AI can suggest appropriate architectural patterns based on the schema's guidance.

## Schema Validation

### Required Validation Rules
1. **Semantic Versioning**: `openai_schema` must follow semver
2. **Required Fields**: All required fields must be present
3. **Enumerated Values**: Fields like `complexity_level` must use specified values
4. **Consistent Structure**: All patterns must include required subfields

### Recommended Validation Rules
1. **Code Examples**: All code examples should be syntactically valid
2. **Link Validation**: All URLs should be accessible
3. **Consistency Checks**: Terminology should be consistent throughout
4. **Completeness**: Core workflows should be fully documented

## Evolution and Versioning

### Schema Versioning
- **Major Version**: Breaking changes to required structure
- **Minor Version**: New optional sections or fields
- **Patch Version**: Clarifications and corrections

### Backward Compatibility
- AI models should gracefully handle unknown fields
- Required fields should not be removed in minor versions
- Deprecated fields should be marked before removal

## Future Directions

### Planned Extensions
1. **Multi-language Support**: Schemas for polyglot projects
2. **Dependency Modeling**: Explicit dependency relationships
3. **Performance Profiles**: Runtime and resource characteristics
4. **Integration Matrices**: Compatibility with other technologies
5. **Learning Paths**: Structured progression for mastering tools

### Community Development
1. **Schema Registry**: Centralized repository of schemas
2. **Tooling Ecosystem**: Validators, generators, and analyzers
3. **Best Practices**: Community-driven guidelines
4. **Metrics**: Effectiveness measurements for AI usage

## Conclusion

The AI Framework Schema (AFS) specification provides a foundation for creating AI-consumable documentation that enables rapid, accurate understanding of software systems. By following this specification, tool creators can help AI models become instant experts, leading to better code generation, more accurate recommendations, and more effective development assistance.
